# Environment
- Ubuntu 16.04(train) / Windows10(test)
- python 3.5+(have installed the neccessary dependencies)
	- pytorch==0.4.1
	- torchvision==0.2.2
	- pillow
- Graphics: Tian XP(train) / 1050Ti(test)

# Train
#### Step1
```sh
Clone or download this repository and install the neccessary dependencies.
```
#### Step2
```sh
Unzip the dataset which is from https://www.kaggle.com/asdasdasasdas/garbage-classification/version/2.
for example:
run "unzip GarbageData.zip"
```
#### Step3
```sh
Modify the config.py according to your needs.
